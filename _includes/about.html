                  Hi everyone! An eclectic autodidact here who is excited by human centric technology and its potential to improve our well being. As a kid, the only superpower I seemed to have was an unsatiable curiosity, to the dismay of my parents who had to bear the brunt of all my questions. To this day, I have still managed to retain most of that. I have dabbled in various fields since the second year of my undergrad including device modelling and VLSI. I was then entasked to solve a problem in medical imaging during which I came across Deep Learning models that were setting SOTA standards.

At the end of my third year of undergrad, I had an opportunity to intern at Bhabha Atomic Research Center, Mumbai in Deep Learning for Xray images. I was able to leverage the knowledge I gained in this role to land an internship at Healthcare Technology and Innovation Center, Chennai, India. Since then, I have worked in various projects all centered around the application of statistics and machine learning to biosignal anaytics and biomedical imaging. Apart from improving my understanding of core subjects like Digital Signal Processing and Matrix analysis, I have also improved my coding skills to a point where I am comfortable with both academic and production level code. Recently, I have also had the opportunity to manage a team of 10 and learnt about what it means to be a leader in the process.

While my initial foray into ML and AI for medical applications stemmed from me succumbing to the hype and allure surrounding it, I have since expanded my understanding of its potential and flaws and seek to enable its smooth transition from the desks of research into a scaled industrial environment. To this end, I enjoy leveraging the latest technology to ask the right questions and finding optimal solutions.
